which charges

date 25/4 --> some don't have the avvi


I checked the provided example, please let me recap what I understood and the proposed solution/experience and let me know if any points were missed.

Currently the script doesn't extract the "Court Case Number"
This field will be used to get the Affidavit
The Affidavit is usually ready to be extracted after ~ 3 days of the arrest date

So, for the example you provided on Apr 25
The Court Case Number exists and the PDF could be found

however, for some other inmates in the Apr 25 search results,
the PDF COMPLAINT & ADVISORY" is not available yet
so I believe we may need to mark the inmates that could'nt find their affidavit yet with a unique value in the output file

one more inquiry
many inmates have more than 1 charge, so which court case number should be extracted for them?
since this will impact the way we're going to show the results in the output file

Regarding the script updates/new experience, I recommend the following:
The current script version iterates over the input dates and start scraping each date and export its data in a separate file

I believe the best way to update the scraper is add the new scraping logic after the inmate data of each date is completely scraped
Since the affidavit extraction is done through different URLs and requires different logic
so the scraping steps will be as follows:

1. Read input dates
2. Extract the inmate data of the first date including the new "Court Case Number" and export the Excel file
3. For each inmate extracted in the previous step, follow the provided steps to extract the affidavit and append its data to the Excel file
4. Proceed with the next dates
